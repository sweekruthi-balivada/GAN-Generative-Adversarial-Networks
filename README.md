Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a revolutionary deep learning architecture known for its ability to generate realistic data, including images, audio, and text, through adversarial training. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, engaged in a competitive game where the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic outputs, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data. This repository explores various GAN variants and techniques for image generation tasks, offering insights into their capabilities and potential applications in diverse domains.
